# per-agent-thinking-level Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change support-full-thinking-levels. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Agent thinking field accepts valid thinking levels

The agent definition parser SHALL accept the `thinking` frontmatter field as a string representing a valid thinking level. Valid levels are `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `xhigh`.

#### Scenario: Valid thinking level accepted
- **WHEN** an agent `.md` file contains `thinking: high`
- **THEN** `parseAgentFile()` returns a definition with `thinking: "high"`

#### Scenario: All six levels accepted
- **WHEN** an agent `.md` file contains any of `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `xhigh`
- **THEN** `parseAgentFile()` returns the definition with that exact string value

### Requirement: Legacy boolean values mapped to valid levels

The agent definition parser SHALL accept legacy `on`/`off`/`true`/`false` values for the `thinking` field and map them to valid thinking levels.

#### Scenario: Legacy `on` mapped to medium
- **WHEN** an agent `.md` file contains `thinking: on`
- **THEN** `parseAgentFile()` returns a definition with `thinking: "medium"`

#### Scenario: Legacy `off` mapped to off
- **WHEN** an agent `.md` file contains `thinking: off`
- **THEN** `parseAgentFile()` returns a definition with `thinking: "off"`

#### Scenario: Legacy `true` mapped to medium
- **WHEN** an agent `.md` file contains `thinking: true`
- **THEN** `parseAgentFile()` returns a definition with `thinking: "medium"`

#### Scenario: Legacy `false` mapped to off
- **WHEN** an agent `.md` file contains `thinking: false`
- **THEN** `parseAgentFile()` returns a definition with `thinking: "off"`

### Requirement: Invalid thinking values produce a warning

The agent definition parser SHALL emit a console warning when the `thinking` field contains an unrecognized value and SHALL fall back to `"medium"`.

#### Scenario: Unrecognized value warned and defaulted
- **WHEN** an agent `.md` file contains `thinking: unknown`
- **THEN** a console warning is emitted indicating the unrecognized thinking level
- **AND** `parseAgentFile()` returns a definition with `thinking: "medium"`

### Requirement: Missing thinking field defaults to off

When the `thinking` field is absent from an agent's frontmatter, the parser SHALL default the thinking level to `"off"`.

#### Scenario: No thinking field in frontmatter
- **WHEN** an agent `.md` file does NOT contain a `thinking` field
- **THEN** `parseAgentFile()` returns a definition with `thinking: "off"`

### Requirement: Thinking level passed to CLI as valid value

The dispatch function SHALL pass the agent's thinking level directly to the `pi` CLI via `--thinking <level>` where `<level>` is one of the six valid thinking level strings.

#### Scenario: Agent with explicit level gets correct CLI flag
- **WHEN** a task is dispatched to an agent with `thinking: "high"`
- **THEN** the spawned `pi` process receives `--thinking high`

#### Scenario: Agent with off level gets correct CLI flag
- **WHEN** a task is dispatched to an agent with `thinking: "off"`
- **THEN** the spawned `pi` process receives `--thinking off`

#### Scenario: Agent with medium level gets correct CLI flag
- **WHEN** a task is dispatched to an agent with `thinking: "medium"`
- **THEN** the spawned `pi` process receives `--thinking medium`

#### Scenario: Legacy mapped value produces valid CLI flag
- **WHEN** a task is dispatched to an agent whose `thinking: on` was mapped to `"medium"`
- **THEN** the spawned `pi` process receives `--thinking medium`
